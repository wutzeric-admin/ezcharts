# ezcharts
This repository gives examples of EZCharts code that can be used in SPAN (https://www.banyanboard.com/span). The repository is split into examples by sports. In each folder, there is a sample CSV file which is produced from the sample SPAN template. The EZCharts code is template specific, hence will work only with data created from the respective template.
